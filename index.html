        <h2>Everything You Need to Know about Sloths</h2>
        <p>Sloths are highly successful, slow-moving mammals that spend their lives hanging about in the trees of Central and South America.  There are two families of sloths: two-toed sloths (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-toed_sloth">Megalonychidae</a>) and three-toed sloths (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-toed_sloth">Bradypodidae</a>). Despite being very slow and very lazy, they are incredibly strong, are skilled swimmers, and can muster up great bursts of speed to escape preditors.<br>
          <br>
        Sloths move so slowly that algae actually grows on their fur.  However, they have a symbiotic relationship with that algae.  It provides them with camouflage, extra nutrients that diffuse through their skin, and even a source of food for their young.  The algae in turn gets nutrients, water, and a protected place to grow from the sloth. <br>
        <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5551/14825664690_815a8ca2e6_b.jpg"><br>
        There are six glorious living species of sloths: two two-toed sloths and four three-toed sloths.<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus)</li>
          <li>Hoffmann's two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni)</li>
          <li>Brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus)</li>
          <li>Maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus)</li>
          <li>Pale-throated sloth (Bradypus tridactylus)</li>
          <li>Pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus)</li>
        </ul><br>
        Unfortunately, the pygmy sloth (shown below) is critically endangered, and the maned sloth is vulnerable.<br>

      Sloths have distinctive features such as long claws, buggy eyes, long legs and fur tinted green from the algae that grow in it. If there were fast-moving meat eaters they would be the stuff of nightmares. Luckily though sloths are super duper slow (hence the name!) and are folivores, meaning they eat mainly leafy things. Hibiscus flowers are one of their favorite treats.</p>
